# Lines Plus
A 2 player (controllers) line game.<BR />
<BR />
Survivor gets 3 points.<BR />
Squares are worth 1 point.<BR />
Do not collide with other lines or (yellow) circles with your head.<BR />
Bouncing circles erase lines and another appears every 5 seconds with a short no collision (magenta).<BR />
You are invincible until first move unless you hit the wall on the other side.<BR />
F toggles fullscreen<BR />
1-5 will eventually toggle AI difficulty. (0 to return to 2 Player).<BR />
Steer with controller triggers.<BR />
You get one short invincibility and invisibility per round by pressing A (X).<BR />
B X Y or circle square triangle pauses during gameplay.<BR />
Q or ESC quits<BR />
Win condition is 100 points for a Set.<BR />
There is a game.ini to modify settings. (Options coming soon(tm))<BR />
<BR />
Below is the licensing.<BR />
No liability if you use anything here. 
<BR />
This is not free software. If it is used for commercial use then it requires negotiable royalty (10%+). 04/28/2025<BR />
Negotiations are with the original orange. The guy typing this out.<BR />
What does that mean? They've been cloning for decades (maybe millinnia), don't bullshit me.<BR />
This is not free software and requires royalties for commercial use.<BR />
Royalties are required for songgen.cpp songgen.h and instruments.h<BR />
The other linesplus code is free and cannot be resold.<BR />
Interested parties can find my contact information at https://github.com/ZacGeurts<BR />
<BR />
Will anyone show any interest in it? Doubtful, but I have been ripped off with everything I've ever created and would like the chance to not be taken advantage of and miss the bus.<BR />
<BR />
Why is this not free? Because Lines Plus is 3% of the product. The real meat is the songgen that pretty much makes more songs than grains of sand in the universe.<BR />
How does it work? Soon(tm) as it is not uploaded.

Type `make` to build. Needs OpenGL (Mesa) and SDL2.
